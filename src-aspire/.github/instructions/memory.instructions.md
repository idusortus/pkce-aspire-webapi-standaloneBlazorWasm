# Project Pause Summary (Aug 2025)

- Project: .NET Aspire API with Keycloak authentication
- Structure: Modular (Api, Host, ServiceDefaults), but not full Clean/Vertical Slice Architecture
- Design Patterns: Dependency Injection, Extension Methods, Configuration Pattern, Interface Abstraction, Modularization, Middleware Pipeline
- Architecture: Not professional Clean or Vertical Slice; modular but organized by technical concern
- Refactoring Suggestions:
  - Organize endpoints/features by domain/vertical slice
  - Centralize and strongly-type configuration
  - Group service registration logic
  - Isolate authentication/authorization logic
  - Use interfaces consistently
  - Move manual tests to automated test project
  - Group extension methods by target/feature
  - Consider further modularization for Clean Architecture
- No major tasks in progress; last action was architectural/code review and refactoring advice

Resume here for next steps or further refactoring!
